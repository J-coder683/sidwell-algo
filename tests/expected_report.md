## 4. Margin-of-Safety Check
Current Stock Price: **₹50.00**
DCF Intrinsic Value: **₹27.02**
Required Margin of Safety: **25.00%** ( Graham & Dodd standard)
Computed Margin of Safety: Trading at 1.9x intrinsic value (target ≤ 0.75x)
### Status: [FAIL] ❌
The stock trades above the safety threshold. Trading at 1.9x intrinsic value is insufficient for investment under the Buffett framework.

**RECOMMENDATION: WAIT**

High-quality business that satisfies key quality criteria, but currently lacks a sufficient margin of safety (current price 50.00 is higher than the target buy price of 20.27). Wait for a pullback.

**Action Item**: Set alert at buy-trigger price: **₹20.27** (75% of intrinsic value).
